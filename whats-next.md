# What's Next: GUI Planning Phase

## Overview

The next development phase focuses on planning and implementing a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for the advisor agent, leveraging the **Kandoo Codex Design Language** (see `KANDOO-CODEX-DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md`).

## Current Status

- **Branch**: GUI-fork (forked from main advisor agent)
- **CLI Functionality**: Fully operational and maintained
- **Design Reference**: KANDOO-CODEX-DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md document ready

## Next Session Objectives

### Research & Analysis Phase

1. **Design Language Analysis**
   - Utilize design and front-end specialist agents
   - Deep dive into Kandoo Codex design patterns
   - Extract key UI/UX principles applicable to advisor interface

2. **Adaptation Planning**
   - Map existing CLI workflow to GUI components
   - Design streaming response visualization
   - Plan interview question flow in graphical format
   - Integrate typewriter animation for real-time advisor output

3. **Technical Architecture**
   - Component structure planning
   - State management for conversation flow
   - Integration with existing advisor agent backend
   - Maintain CLI backward compatibility

### Key Design Features to Implement

- **Cyberpunk glass-morphic aesthetic** - Multi-layered glass surfaces with neon accents
- **Animated code rain background** - Falling syntax-highlighted code snippets
- **Typewriter text animation** - Character-by-character streaming responses
- **Spring physics interactions** - Framer Motion for natural, tactile feel
- **Dark-first design** - Optimized for developer workflows

## Expected Deliverables

From the next session, we expect:
1. Comprehensive GUI architecture plan
2. Component hierarchy and design specifications
3. Integration strategy preserving existing functionality
4. Implementation roadmap with phased approach

## Notes

- This is a planning and research phase, not immediate implementation
- Focus on thoughtful design adaptation, not rushing to code
- Preserve all existing CLI functionality while adding GUI layer
- Design agents will help translate Kandoo Codex patterns to advisor context
